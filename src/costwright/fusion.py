"""costwright.fusion — the "cartesian product of certificates" (spec 003, Exp #4).

A run of an LLM agent can carry TWO INDEPENDENT certificates:

  1. a COST certificate (this repo, costwright.v1): static, ahead-of-time, holds on EVERY trace,
     backed by the Lean 4 cost-soundness theorem (typed-resources, vsteps_sound, no sorry);
  2. a RISK certificate (eleata-verify `verify()`): per-output, a population selective-risk SLA
     (Geifman & El-Yaniv 2017) on i.i.d. data from the calibration domain, or an abstention.

This module BUNDLES the two into a single `costwright.fusion.v1` audit record — their CARTESIAN
PRODUCT — and is deliberately conservative about what that bundle is ALLOWED to claim:

  * it is NOT a composed/joint guarantee (`composition.joint_guarantee` is ALWAYS false);
  * there is NO aggregate "both passed" boolean (it would be read as a green safety badge);
  * the honesty disclaimer + the non-interference caveat ship INSIDE every bundle.

ZERO runtime deps + ZERO knowledge of eleata-verify internals: this module is pure stdlib and only
ever reads the SHAPE of `costwright check --json` and of `eleata_verify.VerifyResult.to_dict()` (the
frozen, additive-only contract in eleata-verify/docs/API-CONTRACT.md). It NEVER imports eleata_verify
— so adding fusion keeps costwright's "no runtime dependencies" guarantee intact (verified by tests).

The non-interference theorem (budget ⊥ risk, Hoare-style) that WOULD justify composing the two is
explicitly FUTURE WORK — see docs/NON-INTERFERENCE.md. Do not sell this bundle as a joint guarantee.
